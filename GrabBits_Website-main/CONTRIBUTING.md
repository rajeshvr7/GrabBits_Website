## Style guide for git commit messages  

*Here are some helpful points to enhance your contribution logs.*

- Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Move item to..." instead of "Moves item to...").

- Keep the first line (subject line) within 50 characters or less.

- Capitalize the subject line.

- Separate the subject line from the body with a blank line.

- Do not end the subject line with a period.

- Wrap the body at 72 characters.

- Use the body to explain what, why, versus, and how.

- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

For more detailed reference to the above points, refer [here](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
